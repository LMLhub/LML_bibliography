	Abstract = {This paper develops a continuous time general equilibrium model of a simple but complete economy and uses it to examine the behavior of asset prices. In this model, asset prices and their stochastic properties are determined endogenously. One principal result is a partial differential equation which asset prices must satisfy. The solution of this equation gives the equilibrium price of any asset in terms of the underlying real variables in the economy.},

But those wanting to forecast a typical future cumulative return should be more interested in estimating the median future cumulative return than in estimating the mathematical expected cumulative return. For that purpose, continuous compounding of the mathematical expected log gross return is more relevant than ordinary compounding of the mathematical expected gross return.},

@article{Nowak2006,
	Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. The emergence of genomes, cells, multi-cellular organisms, social insects and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived which specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

Typically, individual x ( t ) are evaluated in terms of time-averaged quantities instead of ensemble averages. Here we discuss the behaviour of the time-averaged mean squared displacement of different stochastic processes giving rise to anomalous diffusion. In particular, we pay attention to the ergodic properties of these processes, i.e. the (non)equivalence of time and ensemble averages.},

	Abstract = {In the random acceleration process considered here, a point particle is accelerated by Gaussian white noise with zero mean. Early work on first-passage and first-return probabilities and some recent applications are reviewed. Motion on the half line x > 0 and on the finite line0 < x < 1 is considered, with two types of boundary conditions, absorbing and inelastic. In colliding inelastically with the boundary, the kinetic energy of the particle decreases. Results for this boundary condition are of interest in connection with driven granular matter. Some applications to semiflexible polymers are discussed where the statistics is the same as for the randomly accelerated particle. Finally, an introduction to the extreme statistics of the random acceleration process is given.},

They find that the density of troughs vanishes in the thermodynamic limit and calculate the scaling of the trough density with L. This is dependent on a tuning parameter that controls the creation of new troughs. SOC, they claim, is a result of observing finite-size effects, a non-zero trough density that would be zero in the TD limit. Leo Kadanoff recommended this paper to me when I told him about AS things.

It turns out that this one bit of information is sufficient to produce the same correlations that would be observed if the vectors Alice and Bob are sharing were fully quantum-entangled, i.e. Bell pairs. It's startling that only one bit is needed; does entanglement not make full use of the three-dimensional vector information?

All SOC mean fields are branching processes. This is argued in sec.I and developed in sec.II. In the presence of dissipation, there's a cut-off function whose argument depends on the level of dissipation as a power law. This type of scaling is assumed for size and duration of avalanches. The corresponding exponents are calculated in sec. IV. The self-organized branching process arises as a mean field description. This model has a critical point p* whose value varies with the level of dissipation. But the fixed point of the dynamics is always p=1/2. It follows that only for 0 dissipation the model is critical, otherwise it is subcritical. \tau and lifetime exponent are also calculated. The authors note that dissipation prevents criticality. {"the level of dissipation acts as a relevant parameter"} and leads to a sub-critical state. The mean field theory for SOC models is always a branching process, with activity being able to branch out or die. This leads to the same mean-field exponents for SOC, e.g. \tau=1.5.},

While slow drive h \to 0 and little dissipation \rho_a \epsilon \to 0 had already been pointed out and justified in Tang and Bak 1988 (J. stat. phys), the limit of h/\epsilon \to 0 is justified here with stationarity of the process (p.5098).

This system is then modelled with the 2d sandpile. The analogy to real sandpiles is also established. Note that the authors speak of DAMPED pendula. For the sandpile analogy they forget the necessity of friction (=damping). Numerical work reveals the avalanche size power law and that for avalanche lifetimes in 2s and 3d. Lifetimes are assumed to be related to the size by exponential spreading of activity in the cluster. They find p(s) ~ s^(-0.98).

	Optnote = {This is a paper about Reggeon Field Theory. It is reported that the theory, though formulated like a quantum field theory, is rather a Markov process, called a ''Gribov process''. This Gribov process involves diffusion, absorption (X \to 0) of an entity, autocatalytic reproduction of entities (X \to 2X), the inverse of autocatalytic reproduction (2X \to X), and recombination (2X \to 0). This model is then put on a lattice by defining two processes: I)particles disappear at rate k and II) particles produce an offspring at a neighbouring site at rate k'. This constitutes an example of a Gribov process. Note that all Gribov steps can be reproduced with this simple model. There's also a Reggeon spin model which simply maps onto the same process by identifying up-spin with occupation (and vice versa). Note that all these models have one absorbing state: the vacuum. (This is pointed out in the paper, referring to the term ''absorbing state'' as Markov chain terminology.) The model is then studied analytically and numerically, obtaining scaling relations and exponents in agreement with published values for Reggeon theory. The numerical treatment is very thourough: Several different methods are used to find exponents, enabling consistency-checks. The model is then modified in several ways, e.g. always producing two offspings, if more than one particle appear at one site then they are deleted or replaced by one etc. None of these changes affect the critical behaviour. The authors speculate that since the investigated type of (discrete) RFT is apparently part of a large universality class, continuous RFT might also be part of it. There is no mention of the conjecture that all models with one absorbing state fall in the same universality class (that of directed percolation (DP)). Neither do the authors mention that RFT and DP are in the same universality class. This conjecture came later (in 1981/1982 by Janssen/ Grassberger respectively).},

This model undergoes a secon-order phase transition into an absorbing state. The extension of the DP conjecture seems to be that models with many components (like O_2 and CO) still fall in the DP universality class because only one component at a time will be critical.

	Optnote = {In this paper, a version of the oslo model is studied where the critical slopes are continuous random variables chosen from the interval between 1 and 2. The relaxation rules are as in the original model, but the drive is different: A driving time step corresponds to increasing the slopes at all sites by dz until one site reaches its critical slope value and relaxes, triggering an avalanche (similar to OFC dynamics). In this case, it turns out that, although dz \propto L^{-1}, the energy added to the pile in each step scales as L^{2}. This can be calculated by considering the potential energy of a wedge added onto a slope (\propto L^3 dz). Thus stationarity demands <s> \propto L^2, i.e. we have the scaling law D(2-\tau)=2, which is satisfied by a change in \tau to 1.11. D is the same as in the original. The paper also investigates the universality of the oslo model. It can be mapped exactly onto a depinning model (this is not universality in my opinion, since it is an exact mapping). The mapping onto a 1-d OFC model requires a change of one boundary and a change in the relaxation rules (now always relax to 0 force). Still, the exponents of the original are unchanged in this case. The author interprets this as evidence for a large oslo universality class. The model he presents is not in the same universality class according to his definition, since \tau is different. One could argue that \tau is simply not a universal exponent and that instead D determines the universality class. This makes sense because D is very robust indeed. But the author doesn't take this view.},

A set of scaling relations between area, perimeter, radius, time, size are given meaning (e.g. area-perimeter is fractal dimension, time-radius is dynamical exponent z etc). It is argued in this paper that \tau is given by the position in the q-axis where \sigma(q) intercepts it plus 1. This can be calculated easily. The intercept is called (capital) \Sigma. Again, universality is understood as equality of all critical exponents. There's a warning in here to look at more than only the size moments.
